# It's Advent of Code 2024

See https://adventofcode.com. 

Posting my solutions whenever I get to them, usually daily but who knows. 

My personal plan for this year is first solving each one in Python, which I already know, and then in as many other languages I don't know as I can do in a reasonable time (trying get through every day here not get bogged down in doing it for every language), in this order: Go, Rust, Swift. They won't necessarily be the best solutions, especially in those other languages, but the goal here is not to win somehow at this, just learn some new stuff.

If I don't finish all 31 be sure to berate me on whatever social platform you choose.

### Why are there only multiple languages for one of the parts sometimes?

Usually part 2 is just expanding upon part 1, or some minor variation so I'm not spending time translating just a subset piece of the same code thanks, I will do whichever one is actually interesting
