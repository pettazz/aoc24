# It's Advent of Code 2024

See https://adventofcode.com. 

Posting my solutions whenever I get to them, usually daily but who knows. 

My personal plan for this year is first solving each one in Python, which I already know, and then in as many other languages I don't know as I can do in a reasonable time, in this order: Go, Rust, Swift. They won't necessarily be the best solutions, especially in those other languages, but the goal is really just to learn the basics.

If I don't finish all 31 be sure to berate me on whatever social platform you choose.
